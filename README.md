# rust-palestrina

This is a Rust port of my npm library [Palestrina](https://github.com/sevriarch/palestrina), a toolkit for algorithmic music composition.

It should not be considered production-worthy, as it's being written as a way of bootstrapping my learning of Rust.

If this status changes in the future, this README will be appropriately updated.
